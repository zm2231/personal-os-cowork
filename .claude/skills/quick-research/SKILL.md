**Example 2: Claim Verification**
```
User: /quick-research --verify-claims "AI agents can fully replace human workers in 2025" --cross-check

PersonalOS:
Claim Verification: "AI agents can fully replace human workers in 2025"

Claim: AI agents will be capable of fully replacing human workers across all industries by 2025

Verification Results:

Evidence FOR the claim:
- Some companies are experimenting with agent-based customer service (scale, not replacement)
- AI agents can automate specific tasks (but not entire jobs)
- Progress in tool calling and autonomy is accelerating

Evidence AGAINST the claim:
- No credible source predicts full replacement by 2025
- Leading AI researchers agree "replacement is decades away, not years"
- McKinsey 2024 report: "AI will augment, not replace, most jobs through 2030"
- Goldman Sachs 2024 report: "300 million jobs AFFECTED, not replaced, by AI"
- Current agents lack: reasoning at human level, general adaptability, physical capabilities
- 2025 is 1 year away; current agents still struggle with basic tasks

Expert Opinions:
- Andrew Ng (Stanford): "AI will augment human workers, not replace them"
- Daphne Koller (Coursera founder): "Full automation of complex jobs is unlikely in this decade"
- Sam Altman (OpenAI): "AI will change how we work, not eliminate work"

Fact-Check:
- Claim source: Viral social media posts, some tech blogs
- Credibility: Low (no peer-reviewed sources, no expert consensus)
- Plausibility: Extremely low (current technology limitations)

Confidence Rating:
**CLAIM LIKELY FALSE** (95% confidence)

Why the claim is misleading:
1. Confuses "task automation" with "job replacement"
2. Ignores current agent limitations (reasoning, adaptability, physical tasks)
3. cherry-picks narrow examples (customer service bots) and generalizes
4. No credible experts or research support this timeline

Corrected Claim:
"AI agents will increasingly augment human workers and automate specific tasks, but full job replacement is unlikely before 2030+ for most roles."

Evidence:
- Agent specialization trend (Developer agents, Researcher agents, etc.)
- Multi-agent coordination research (agent swarms, agent teams)
- Users need specialized agents for different tasks

Predicted Scenario:
One user has 5+ specialized agents:
- **DevAgent:** Code review, debugging, testing (Hermes-based)
- **ResearchAgent:** Quick research, fact-checking, synthesis (Cowork-based)
- **AdminAgent:** Email, scheduling, task management (Sidekick-based)
- **CreativeAgent:** Writing, design, presentations (Cowork-based)
- **AnalyticsAgent:** Data analysis, reporting, forecasting (specialized)

Agents communicate via standard protocol:
```
ResearchAgent → "User needs to research market trends"
AdminAgent → "I'll schedule time for research session"
DevAgent → "I'll set up data pipeline for analysis"
```

Impact:
- Highly specialized, optimized agents
- Users orchestrate agent teams
- New "agent orchestration" meta-layer

---

Prediction 5: Enterprise Skill Libraries (2025-2027)
- **Timeline:** 12-36 months
- **Confidence:** 80%

Evidence:
- Enterprises already creating internal skill packs
- Case studies: Company A internal knowledge management
- Need for proprietary workflows and data

Predicted Pattern:
Company builds internal skill library:
- Company-specific workflows (onboarding, compliance, processes)
- Proprietary data integration (internal APIs, databases)
- Custom integrations (Jira, Salesforce, internal tools)

Some internal skills become open source (with sensitive parts removed):
- "Our code review skill works great, let's share the template"
- Community improves, company benefits

Impact:
- Enterprise adoption of agent systems
- Open source skills from enterprise use cases
- Blurring line between internal and open source

**Confidence Ranking of Predictions:**

1. Skill Format Standardization (90%) ✅ Highly confident
2. Enterprise Skill Libraries (80%) ✅ Confident
3. Skill Marketplace Emergence (75%) ✅ Likely
4. AI-Powered Skill Generation (60%) ⚠️ Possible
5. Multi-Framework Agent Ecosystems (55%) ⚠️ Speculative

**Strategic Implications for PersonalOS:**

Short-Term (2025):
- Design skill format to be future-compatible with upcoming standard
- Prepare for multi-framework support (even if Cowork-only initially)
- Build enterprise-friendly features (custom integrations, data privacy)

Medium-Term (2026-2027):
- Plan for skill marketplace submission (Cowork Skills Hub)
- Consider AI-assisted skill generation for users
- Explore multi-agent coordination patterns

Long-Term (2027-2028):
- Consider PersonalOS as part of larger agent ecosystem
- Design for interoperability with other frameworks
- Position as specialized "productivity agent" within multi-agent system

**Risks and Uncertainties:**

Risk 1: One framework dominates (e.g., Cowork becomes standard)
- Mitigation: PersonalOS is Cowork-native; good position if this happens

Risk 2: Fragmentation continues (no standard emerges)
- Mitigation: Focus on Cowork ecosystem; don't over-engineer for other frameworks

Risk 3: AI skill generation makes skill development obsolete
